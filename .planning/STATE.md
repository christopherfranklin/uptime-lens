# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Indie developers know instantly when their sites or services go down -- and trust the product enough to pay for it month over month.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Authentication

Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In Progress

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 25 requirements at fine granularity
- [Roadmap]: Check engine (Phase 4) separated from incident detection/alerting (Phase 5) to isolate the state machine complexity
- [Roadmap]: Database rollup schema designed in Phase 1 (not deferred) per research Pitfall #3
- [Phase 01]: Used Proxy pattern for lazy db client initialization to avoid crash without DATABASE_URL
- [Phase 01]: Replaced ESLint with Biome for combined linting and formatting
- [Phase 01]: Used neon() client constructor for proper Neon HTTP driver initialization
- [Phase 01]: Used Proxy pattern for Resend client (same as db client) to avoid build crash when RESEND_API_KEY is not set
- [Phase 01]: Deleted root app/page.tsx in favor of app/(marketing)/page.tsx route group for landing page
- [Phase 01]: Used nativeButton={false} on Base UI Button components rendered as Link elements to fix accessibility warning
- [Phase 01]: Worker uses @neondatabase/serverless neon() for DB connectivity check, consistent with web app pattern
- [Phase 02]: Used delegate pattern for vi.mock closures to solve Vitest module caching across tests
- [Phase 02]: Installed @better-auth/drizzle-adapter as separate package (re-exported by better-auth but needs explicit install)
- [Phase 02]: Fixed Biome v2 config (ignore -> includes) and lint script (--apply -> --write)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Tremor + Next.js 16 / React 19.2 compatibility needs verification during Phase 6 planning
- [Research]: BullMQ repeatable job behavior at scale (500+ monitors) needs validation during Phase 4 planning
- [Research]: Neon connection pooling under write-heavy worker load needs validation during Phase 4 planning
