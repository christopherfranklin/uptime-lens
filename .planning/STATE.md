## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 25 requirements at fine granularity
- [Roadmap]: Check engine (Phase 4) separated from incident detection/alerting (Phase 5) to isolate the state machine complexity
- [Roadmap]: Database rollup schema designed in Phase 1 (not deferred) per research Pitfall #3

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Tremor + Next.js 16 / React 19.2 compatibility needs verification during Phase 6 planning
- [Research]: BullMQ repeatable job behavior at scale (500+ monitors) needs validation during Phase 4 planning
- [Research]: Neon connection pooling under write-heavy worker load needs validation during Phase 4 planning
